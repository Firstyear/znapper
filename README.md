# Znapper - Znap your Snaps

Znapper is a tool to help automate zfs snapshot management on larger pools. This is similar to
zfs-auto-snap, but goes a bit further to help manage snapshots over replicated pools for backups
within a single host.

## Auto snapshot management

To automatically snapshot *all* pools on your system which have *mounted* filesystems:

```
znapper snapshot
```

To clean-up old automatic snapshots

```
znapper snapshot_cleanup <poolname> <hours worth of snapshots to keep>
znapper snapshot_cleanup tank 48
```

## Replication management

This is really what znapper was designed to do. Let's say you have two pools, a smaller nvme pool
and a larger disk backed pool named tank.

On the smaller nvme pool, because it's smaller we can not keep as many snapshots due to space
limitations. We want to replicate nvme to tank for archival / redundancy, but also to allow extended
snapshots to be stored in tank.

To initialise the replication:

```
znapper init_repl <from filesystem> <to filesystem>
znapper init_repl nvme tank/nvme
```

To then do an incremental replication

```
znapper repl <from filesystem> <to filesystem>
znapper repl nvme tank/nvme
```

# How does it work? 

The reason auto snapshot only snapshots mounted filesystems is so that any replication target (ie
tank/nvme) is NOT snapshot hourly in the background.

This is also why snapshot cleanup requires a pool name, because when snapshots are sent from nvme
to tank, we can then cleanup tank/nvme's auto snapshots based on tank's policy which can be
longer than the nvme policy.

Replication uses different snapshots as points in times for replication, so even removing all the
auto snapshots on either side will NOT break the replication process.

Any replicated filesystem is *not* mounted and marked as read-only in the process. To restore from
one of these snapshots, you can either zfs send back to the original pool, or temporarily mount
the fs to manually recover.
